# Outline of script to convert wiki pages to GIT markdown

1. Script to read the sqlite database.
2. Extract all the wiki pages, in 'time' order
  * for each page, create or update, a markdown page
  * convert the wiki markup into markdown
  * for all pages with the same 'time' commit them 

## Notes

  * What to do with attachments (do I have many?)
  * Need to make it a 'private' repository. (i.e. gitlab)
